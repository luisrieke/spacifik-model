## My principles on how to build great tech products

1. Get shit done. Better done then perfect. Try to ship valuable stuff every day. Tiny improvements on a regular basis get the job done. Do a lot of small experiments and also sunset features which don't work. Try to build fast and with consistency. Don't overthink. Stop talking & planning and start building.

2. Be relentlessly focused on enhancing the users life. Customer needs are your one priority. Stay close to the users, be a user yourself, be their advocate. Everyone should talk to users on a regular basis. Answer support tickets. Understand user pain points deeply.

3. Strive to create products that you build once, but continue to generate value forever. Like a book that, once written, offers enduring worth. Don’t trade your time for money. Focus on creating value that outlasts you.

4. Keep it simple. Focus on the essential to solve a problem.

5. Good products are environmentally friendly. Timeless design avoids trends that quickly fade, ensuring a product has longevity both in function and aesthetics.

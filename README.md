## My principles on how to build great tech products

1. Get shit done. Fail fast. Better done then perfect. Try to ship valuable stuff every day. Tiny improvements on a regular basis get the job done. Do a lot of small experiments and also sunset features early on which don't work. Try to build fast and with consistency. Don't overthink shit. Stop talking & planning and start shipping.

2. Users first, always. Be relentlessly focused on enhancing the users life. Customer needs are the one priority. No compromises — if it’s bad for users, it’s out. If it's evil, it's out. Screw politics. No deal is worth sacrificing user trust. Stay close to the users, be a user yourself, be their advocate. Everyone should talk to users on a regular basis. Read and answer support tickets and reviews. Understand user pain points deeply.

3. Strive to create products that you build once, but continue to generate value forever. Think sustainable. Like a book that, once written, offers enduring worth. Don’t trade time for money. Focus on creating value that outlasts you. Good products are environmentally friendly. Timeless design avoids trends that quickly fade, ensuring a product has longevity both in function and aesthetics.

4. Keep it simple. Focus on the essential to solve a problem.

5. A company should have a shared purpose employes and customers can identify with. Every product should be build with a longterm vision. Every team should have a defined measurable ambitious mission.

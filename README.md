My guiding principles for building tech products:

1. Customer Centricity: Customer needs are the top priority. Be relentlessly focused on enhancing the user experience. Stay close to the users, be a user of the products you build. Everyone should talk to users on a regular basis. Understand user needs and pain points deeply. Be their advocate.
